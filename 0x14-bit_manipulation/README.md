0x14. C - Bit manipulation

0. 0 - Converts a binary number tinto an unsigned int
	b represents the binary number. *bin points to b
	The function first checks if b is NULL & if it is returns 0
	Then, function using th for loop loops through each character 
	in string 'b'checking for 0 and or 1. 
	If character is not 0 or 1, 0 is returned
	If character is count is shifted leftwards one bit and 0 is added to the
